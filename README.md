# Android Demo App

Basically this is a android scrapper with a server-like sevice running in a seperate process as a Service 24/7, which rescrapes in a repeating pattern accoring to the time set. Easily the most complex app that I build and uses most of the Android Components in one way or another.

## Getting Started

Below I have given a list of everything that was used to build this project.

## Built using Libraries

* [Joda-Time Android](https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android) - Replacement for the Java date and time classes.
* [JSOUP](https://jsoup.org/) - Java library for parsing with real-world HTML.
* [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation.
* [Stetho](https://github.com/facebook/stetho) - Sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications.
* [Apache Commons IO](https://github.com/apache/commons-io) - Library contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.
* [Butter Knife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) - View Injection Library
* [EventBus](EventBus) - Publish/Subscribe event bus optimized for Android.
* [MultiProcessPreference](https://github.com/hamsterksu/MultiprocessPreferences) - Allow use of shared preferences between a different processes of same app.
* [Crashlytics](https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics/summary) - Crash reporting solution.

## Design Patterns

* **Architecture Patterns** - Model-View-Presenter
* **Creational design patterns** - Builder, Singleton, Abstract, Factory Method, Object Pool

* **Behavioral design patterns** - Chain of responsibility, Null Object, Observer, Mediator

## Android Components

* Service, IInterface(AIDL), Notification, IBinder
* AlarmManager, PendingIntent
* BroadcastReceiver
* MultiProcesses (android:process)
* SQLiteOpenHelper
* PackageManager
* FileProvider
* Views - RecyclerView, DrawerLayout, NavigationView, CardView, Toolbar, Spinner, TextInputLayout, CoordinatorLayout, ViewPager, ScrollView
